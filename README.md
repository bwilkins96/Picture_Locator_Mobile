# Overview
This is a mobile app I created, using the Ionic framework, for SWDV 665: Advanced Topics in Software Development at Maryville University. 
The app stores user-taken pictures with the addresses where the pictures were taken. The app can also provide the userâ€™s current address, to the street level, and lat/long on demand.

# To Run 
Download this repository and cd into the local directory
Run npm install
Run ionic serve - (This requires that ionic v7 is installed: npm install -g @ionic/cli)
